**Project Proposal**

**Project Title:**

Ludo game using OOP in c++

**Group Members:**

1.  Asad Khan-\[24K-0580\]

2.  Hassan Nasir-\[24K-1031\]

3.  Jiyanshu Raj-\[24K-0987\]

**1) Introduction:**

-   **Background:**

> This project focuses on using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++
>
> to develop a desktop based Ludo game. It aims to apply the core OOP
> principles: inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism
> while at the same time also utilizing graphics based interaction via
> the raylib GUI library.

-   **Problem Statement:**

> The majority of programming projects for beginners concentrate on
> console-based applications. By creating an interactive GUI-based Ludo
> game that showcases practical applications of OOP ideas like class
> hierarchy, polymorphic behaviour, and event-driven interactions, this
> project bridges the gap between text-based learning and graphical
> development.

-   **Objectives:**

    -   Build a functioning game

    -   Apply principles of OOP in the code of the program

    -   Develop a beginner level application using GUI

    -   Demonstrating interaction using inputs and animations

**2)Scope of the project:**

-   **Inclusions:** The game consists of 4 different teams represented
    by different colours. A dice is rolled by each team taking turns and
    advancing through the board with the ability to eliminate the pieces
    of other teams unless they are on a safe spot. The game will
    continue until all 4 pieces of 3 teams will get to "home" after
    advancing the board completely

-   **Exclusions:** It is an offline game and does not contain
    AI-controlled players/teams. The animations are not fancy and the
    game cannot also be saved to be played later from the same stages

**3)** **Project Description:**

-   **Overview:** The project, which was developed using C++ OOP design,
    is a GUI based simulation of the classic Ludo board game. The base
    token class is the source of each players tokens. Furthermore the
    game uses event based logic to control token movement, dice rolling,
    and turns. While all of this is happening raylib is simultaneously
    being used for displaying the GUI, allowing for a more engaging user
    experience.

-   **Technical Requirements:**

    -   IDE

    -   MinGW or g++

    -   Rayib Graphics Library

    -   Windows Operating System

    -   Microsoft Word for documentation

-   **Project Phases:**

1)  **Research & Planning:** Understanding how to make a GUI using
    raylib library and the rules of the game

2)  **Design:** Hierarchy of classes or inheritance, game flow and asset
    preparation

3)  **Implementation:** Writing and testing C++ code in modules

4)  **Debugging:** Testing the logic of tokens, elimination of pieces
    and switching turns

5)  **Final Touches:** polishing of UI, cleanup and presentation

**4)Methodology:**

-   **Approach:** The team will follow an organized strategy during the
    development process. To guarantee stability the code will be tested
    following each function and task implemented. Feedback from this
    routine testing will direct our next steps during development of the
    game.

-   **Team Responsibilities:**

    -   Asad Khan: Sound integration, dice animations, polishing
        features and helping in logic

    -   Hassan Nasir: GUI integration using raylib (board display, token
        movement)

    -   Jiyanshu Raj: Core logic & class structure (token classes, dice,
        turns)

**5)Expected Outcomes:**

-   **Deliverables:**

    -   A Working Ludo game

    -   Source code of the game and raylib assets

    -   Usage of all 4 pillars of OOP (Abstraction, Encapsulation,
        Inheritance, and Polymorphism)

    -   To play the game open the application, then use the left-click
        of the mouse of the dice to roll it, if it's a 6 then a piece
        will be unlocked and roll the dice again and click on the piece
        which you want to move. Play till the board is advanced
        completely and all 4 pieces reach home

-   **Relevance:** This project offers an entertaining and interesting
    way to practice C++ programming skills by utilizing important
    concepts like object-oriented design, control structures (turn
    management), and data organization (token positions and user input).

-   **6)Resources Needed:**
